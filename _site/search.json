However, sepal width and length still overlap between the Versicolor and Virginica types. Further analysis in the graph below reveals a comparison when looking at petal dimensions and groupings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now clearly distinguish 3 exact groupings based on Petal dimensions of each species ranging in increasing size order from Setosa to Virginica. The combination of Sepal and Petal dimensions could potentially be later used for investigations into common classification problems in identifying flower types."
